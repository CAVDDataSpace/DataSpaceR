```

A thin wrapper around Rlabkey to access the [CAVD DataSpace](https://dataspace-staging.cavd.org)
database from R. This package simplifies access to the database for R programmers.

It takes advantage of the standardization of the  database to hide all 
the [Rlabkey](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rlabkey/index.html) 
specific code away from the user. Study-specific datasets can be accessed via 
an object-oriented paradigm.


## Installation

The package can be downloaded here and installed like any other R packages or 
installed directly from github using devtools.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("FredHutch/DataSpaceR")
```

The database is accessed with the user's credentials. A `.netrc` file storing 
login and password information is required.

Create netrc file in the computer running R.

* On a UNIX system this file should be named `.netrc` (**dot** `netrc`) 
* On windows it sould be named `_netrc` (**underscore** `netrc`). 
* The file should be located in the users home directory and the permissions
on the file should be unreadable for everybody except the owner. To determine
home directory, run `Sys.getenv("HOME")` in R.

The following three lines must be included in the `.netrc` or `_netrc` file 
either separated by white space (spaces, tabs, or newlines) or commas.

```
machine dataspace-staging.cavd.org
login myuser@domain.com
password supersecretpassword
```

Multiple such blocks can exist in one file.

See [here](https://www.labkey.org/wiki/home/Documentation/page.view?name=netrc) 
for more information.


## Usage

The general idea is that the user creates an instance of an 
`DataSpaceConnection` class. The instance configures itself to connect to 
a specific study, and datasets can be retrieved by name.

### For example:

```{r}
library(DataSpaceR)
study <- CreateConnection("cvd408")
study
class(study)
```

will create an instance of `cvd408`. The user needs credentials stored in 
a `.netrc` file to access the database. 

### Datasets can be listed by:

```{r}
study$available_datasets
```

which will print names of available datasets.

### Neutralizing antibody dataset (`NAb`) can be retreived by:

```{r}
NAb <- study$getDataset("NAb")
dim(NAb)
colnames(NAb)
```

The package uses a simple R5 reference class to represent the connection to 
a study and get around some of R's copy-on-change behaviour.
